      <p>What is a Getting Started competition?</p>
<p>Getting Started competitions were created by Kaggle data scientists for people who have little to no machine learning background. They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>
<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggleâ€™s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>
<p>How do I create and manage a team?</p>
<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the
We&rsquo;ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don&rsquo;t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the discussion forum.</p>
<p>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</p>
<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a three month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than three months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>
<p>How do I make a submission?</p>
<p>In this unique code competition, you are writing code in a Kaggle notebook that generates an images.zip file containing 7,000-10,000 images sized 256x256. To submit from a notebook, you should:</p>
<p>This is a Code Competition</p>
<p>Submissions to this competition must be made by an output from a python/R or other open source coding language.
The running time should be set by a colab Notebook/Script.</p>
<pre><code>CPU Notebook &lt;= 5 hours run-time
GPU Notebook &lt;= 5 hours run-time
TPU Notebook &lt;= 3 hours run-time
Enabling internet allowed
The submission file must be named images.zip, containing a docker. Review details on the Data Page.

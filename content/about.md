The Airr-seq data competition aims to promote pioneer analysis and novel classification methods for a wide range of clinical and scientific purposes.
     
     
## Our Mission 
Is to improve personalized medicine and immunotherapy for diseases with an immune component, including cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, allergy and infectious diseases, by integrating distributed repositories of Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) data. 



## The 2022 Competition 
Here we present several AIRR-seq datasets that contain various tasks. 
[**Join us to solve them :)**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1r3jZkGVy38Z4-U5pO_YyyNg1FPZurwBw8ZNAAQ94P14/edit)

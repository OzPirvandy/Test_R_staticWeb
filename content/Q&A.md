What is a Getting Started competition?

Getting Started competitions were created by Kaggle data scientists for people who have little to no machine learning background. They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.

Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggleâ€™s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.

How do I create and manage a team?

When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the 
We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the discussion forum.

Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?

To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a three month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than three months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.


How do I make a submission?

In this unique code competition, you are writing code in a Kaggle notebook that generates an images.zip file containing 7,000-10,000 images sized 256x256. To submit from a notebook, you should:
